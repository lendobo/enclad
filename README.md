## Heterogeneous Network Inference and Target Retrieval
This tool performs both network inference and integration in a multi-omic setting. Following single layer inference via a prior-incorporating Gaussian Graphical Model, the layers are "knitted" together via network diffusion. 
Target nodes and communities are also identified in this second step.
